# Classic-Pong
### With a twist

## Note by Owner 
This is a Personal Learning Project. I was learning how to play around with turtle,pygame modules in python. <br>
This is the first project in which I have used turtle. <br>
The credits for the idea, code and logic go to [Christian Thompson's video on FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc&t=8362s). <br>
I have simply tried to follow along and code it myself so that I can learn the basics of the turtle module. <br>
However, I have added 1-2 little extra things just to play around with the game and give it a little twist! <br>

## The Game
This is the code for a Classic Pong Game! <br>
![Image]()<br><br>

The left paddle can be moved using the W,S keys and the right paddle can be moved using the Up, Down Arrow keys. <br>
Whoever reaches 7 points first wins!<br>
The slight twist is that the ball becomes a little bit faster every time a paddle touches it!! <br>
Once the Game is over, simply click on the window to Exit. <br?

#### Enjoy!
